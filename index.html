									<h2><p style= "text-align:center;"></p>About Me</p></h2>
									<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="image left"><img src="images/Profile_Pic.jpg" height="400" alt="" /></span>Hello, my name is Mario Contreras Jr.
									 I am a student pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer information Systems. I have completed my lower division courses and am currently in my upper division courses, my estimated date of graduation is December 2025.
									 I also spend time on the side working on computers and building them for family and friends.
									 I am also working on a text based adventure game in my spare time.
									 Throughout the years, I have become more enamoured with computers and their intricacies, I built my first computer in July of 2014, and have kept upgrading it and adding on since then.
									 I have built and helped build to date a total of 10 computers in ATX, mATX and ITX form factors, my next computer project is utilizing a raspberry pi to run a minecraft server as well as changing my computer from an ATX build to an ITX build.
									 I am not all too knew to the world of computing and networking since I have been dabbling in it from 2014 onwards. Like many computer literate people, I was designated as the household IT tech, when the internet crashed I would be the one to reset the router or check for any outages with my ISP.
									 Additionaly, I was the beginner IT support for my jobs that did not have an IT department but would have computers or office equipment.
									 Currently, I am looking to further my IT career, I have completed a course with Google on Coursera on the fundamentals of Technical Support and am currently studying for a CompTIA A+ certification.
